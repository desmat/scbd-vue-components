# Starter of a library for Vue components

- `/lib` is the real lib
- `/app` is an example app importing and using components (not meant to be polished)

## Devevelopment Workflow

* run the lib to iterate quickly on dev'ing a component:
`/lib> yarn clean && yarn && yarn build && yarn dev`

* run the app to test the built component in a real project:
`/app> yarn clean && yarn && yarn dev`
